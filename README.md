#### Day 1 Polymer 10 oktober 2018
Polymer is a framework by google, which indicates that is probably kept up-to-date. That's why I thought it would be a good framework to work with. In total there are three different versions published by Polymer. I've decided to work with Polymer 3.0, the newest version until now.

The documentation is kept up-to-date by Polymer and it can be found for every version. However troubleshooting is troublesome, because there aren't many people who have worked with Polymer. Even on Stackoverflow there is not a lot to go on, however there are some topics related to Polymer. 

The documentation was a bit though to go through, but that is probably because it's a new framework I had to learn. 

The first day I've looked up tutorials, so I can get started. Eventually we found a boilerplate to set up Polymer. From there I did a lot of research to understand the code and search for all the different possibilities whitin the framework. 

#### Day 2 Polymer 11 oktober 2018
Today I've looked further into the documentation. Followed another beginners tutorial which made it a lot clearer for me. I have learned how to create properties and how to pass them through components. For me it was also important to structure my code in maps. So we have a map with all the pages and a map with the components, which will be included in the pages.
